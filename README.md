### sklearn classification 
#### This repo is self contained with three datasets used by my model sk_classification.
##### Instructions: First install and import the libraries required for both this model and the keras model (https://github.com/antonysama/keras). Both models use the same x_train vector, which is made by this model, here.
####  strength: simple enough for ~80% training set accuracy
####  limitation: no test set accuracy, yet. That is available in the keras model.
